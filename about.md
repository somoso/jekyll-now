### More Information

In my spare time I spend time with the family. Other than that I spend time trying to learn to play the guitar, Netflix, and video games.

### Contact me

I'm not really too keen on leaving personal contact information out on the internet. If you wish to contact me in some way, you can leave an [issue](https://github.com/somoso/somoso.github.io/issues) on this blog.
